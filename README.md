# Kattis Solutions

Here are my solutions to various kattis problems.


## Conga Line

I REALLY wanted to use this as an opportunity to practice test cases. Lots of features of the python language make it clear to express code. For testing, you could create an abstract representation (interface) of a line before one of the five operations, then a similar abstract representation of the line AFTER the instruction (and similarly represent expected output abstractly). The result being, you have a handler to ensure correctness (via test cases) and benchmark performance (again via test cases), regardless of implementation. You get correctness, and benchmarkability, and you can maintain your own code a little better because it makes sense. 

But anywho, I need to leetcode rather than do things the right way.
