# Kattis Solutions

Here are my solutions to various kattis problems. Most of them are in Python. See individual commits for notes on each problem, challenges, and things that worked well. My goal has been to obtain a Kattis score of either 50 or 100 (I am https://open.kattis.com/users/nat1405) through non-trivial problems; to add structure, I have been using the 2020 edition of Principles of Algorithmic Problem Solving (eg, https://www.csc.kth.se/~jsannemo/slask/main.pdf) as a guide.

Feel free to study these solutions, and please reach out with any comments or suggestions!
